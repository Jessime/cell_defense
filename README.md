# Cell Defense

Welcome to Cell Defense, a biology based tower defense game

## Introduction

You play as your bodies immune system, protecting your cells from rounds of virus attacks.
You'll gather resources to build up your bodies defenses.
But if you lose too many cells, and you die. 

## Game

One game lasts 10 rounds.

## Cells

The cells you're defending are found in a row near the bottom of the screen. Each has a certain amount of health, which it will lose if attacked by a virus. If you lose more than half of your cells, the game is over. 

## Viruses

Viruses spawn from the top of the screen and attempt to make their way down to the cells.

## Resources

Resources spawn at random. Consume them to collect, then spend them on defenses

## Defenses

There are several options for defense, each with its own strengths and weaknesses
